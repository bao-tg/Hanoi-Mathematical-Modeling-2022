# Hanoi-Mathematical-Modeling
Introduction: My team is a team ComSci at Hanoi Mathematical Modeling 2022. There are 3 members of my team: Le Nguyen Gia Bao, Duong Thanh Trieu, Truong Gia Bao
Project description:
. In this competition, we need to build a mathematical model to solve the real world-problems. 
. The information of this contest is here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GSUA_8yEL3HKVSjb3YD2dwd0CXY4ln26?usp=sharing (Vietnamese version)
. By using the computational power of Python, we compute and test the sensity and sustainability of our model in this contest.
Brach description:
. In the main branch: There are our codes for testing model and codes of the LaTeX.
. In the master branch: There are the codes that we consult from the previous-year team.
