# Hanoi Mathematical Modeling

## Introduction
We are a Computer Science team participating in the Hanoi Mathematical Modeling competition of 2022. Our team is composed of Le Nguyen Gia Bao, Duong Thanh Trieu, and Truong Gia Bao.

## Project Description
In this competition, our challenge is to create a mathematical model that can tackle real-world issues. Details about the contest can be found in the [Vietnamese version here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cBPuNdgyf6BmWEgQgk5VjX04M0P9zY_l6FxqOvjozWc/edit).

We leverage the computational power of Python to compute, test, and refine the sensitivity and sustainability of our model for the contest.

## Branch Description
- **Main Branch**: This branch contains our code for model testing and LaTeX documentation.
- **Master Branch**: Here, we have archived codes that were developed by the preceding year's team for consultation.
